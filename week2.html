    <h1>Week 2 Reading Notes</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 2: Programming Basics</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Something I forget to utilize is the "typeof" operator. Example: </li> 
            <p>typeof 10</p>
            <p> returns 'number'</p>
            <li>Another thing I forget to utilize is declaring multiple variables at the same time. Example:</li>
            <p>let x=3, y=4, z=5;</p>
            <li>Local scope means a variable only exists within the block that it's declared in</li>
            <li>Global scope means a variable can be used anywhere within a program, but you need to be careful because it can cause problems if you forget you already used it and then try to use it again.</li>
            <li>name.toUpperCase() will change this variable to make all the letters caps</li>
            <li>name.includes('a') will tell us if that letter is included in that string.</li>
            <li>name.startsWith('A') is case-sensitive.</li>
            <li>You can convert a number to a string by using String(3) (replace 3 with whatever number you want to use.</li>
        

        </ul>
    <h2>Chapter 3: Arrays, Logic, and Loops</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Initialize an array called fruit:</li>
                <p>const fruit = [];</p>
                <p>Add a value by putting in the number of the position where you want it placed:</p>
                <p>fruit[1]= banana;</p>
                <p>fruit[0]= apple;</p>
            <li>The join method can turn an array into a string. Example:</li>
                <p>fruit.join();</p>
            <li> fruit.splice(5,0,'orange'); Would put orange at position 5 and not remove any items.</li>
            <li>You can reverse the order of an array by using the reverse() method.</li>
            <li>You can put the contents of an array in alphabetical order by using sort().</li>
            <li>Using indexOf() will tell you the index location of an item in an array.</li>
            <li>Sets are a collection of unique values.</li>
            <li>A value can be placed in a set using the add() method.</li>
            <li>Use the delete() method to remove a value from a set.</li>
            <li>Maps keep a list of key and value pairs. </li>
            <li>Using clear() will remove all keys and values from a map.</li>
            <li>Maps can be converted to arrays using Array.from()</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Chapter 4: Functions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Functions can be entered like a string such as:</li>
                    <p>const hi = new Function('console.log("Hi World!");')</p>
                    <p>This is not recommended though.</p>
                    <li>Functions have to be called in order to run. Make sure to use the function name with parenthesis when calling.</li>

                    <h3>Parameters and Arguments</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Parameters are set when a function is defined.</li>
                        <li>Arguments are provided when the function is invoked.</li>
                            <p>Example:</p>
                            <p>function square(x) {return x*x; }</p>
                            <p>square(4.5);</p>
                            <p>returns 20.25</p>
                        <li>Default parameters can be used when no arguments are provided.</li>
                        <li> Arrow functions are written:</li>
                            <p>const square = x => x*x;</p>
                            <p>This is a shortened way of writing a function.
                            </p>
                    <h3>Callbacks</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                        A function that is passed as an argument to another is known as a callback.
                        </li>
                        <li></li>
                    </ul>
                    </ul>
            </ul>

        ["What is Superman's real name?", "Clark Kent"],
