    <h1>Week 5 Reading Notes</h1>
        <h2>Testing and Debugging</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Errors are usually caused by system error, programmer error, or user error.</li>
                <li>A program will continue running even after a warning is given.</li>
                <li>JS Lint, JS Hint, and ES Lint are linting tools that are designed to test the quality of JS code.</li>
                <li>Debugging is when a programmer finds bugs in their code so they can be fixed. </li>
                <li>Using breakpoints can be helpful for finding bugs because it stops the execution of the code at certain points.</li>
                <li>Using the alert() method will also stop the code from running at certain points until the x is clicked.</li>
                <li>Modern browsers have tools that allow you to set breakpoints.</li>
                <li>Using a debugger command will set a breakpoint in the code. I hadn't heard about this option until now.</li>
                <li>Test-driven Development is when tests are written before writing code in order to use them to test the code once it is written. The tests will initially fail.</li>
                <li>Jest can be used to test code. This can be downloaded in the terminal with "npm install -g jest".</li>
                
            </ul>
