    <h1>Restaurant App Style Guide and Description</h1>
        <h2>Style Guide</h2>
        <p>The app is going to have the title of the restaurant, "The Garbanzo Bean" in the font 'Corinthia' and the color #37514d. The h2 and paragraph text will be in the font 'Open Sans' and color #90aeb2</p>

        <h2>Description of the App</h2>
        <p>I designed this app to be a menu of the restaurant "The Garbanzo Bean." It looks best in the mobile view because most people are going to be looking it up on their phone.
            I created a json file to hold the images and the information for the menu and wrote a function to fetch that information and create the correct elements for each piece of information.
            I also used a Google Map API and placed the map at the bottom of the app so that customers can find the location of the restaurant. 
            The third thing I did in JavaScript was make the title of the restaurant fixed when the customer scrolls through the app.
